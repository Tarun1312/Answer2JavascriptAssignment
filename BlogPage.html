                        Regular Exercise: Keep those tails wagging! Exercise prevents obesity, promotes mental well-being, and strengthens the bond between you and your pet.
                        Grooming Love: Regular brushing, nail trims, and dental care are essential. A well-groomed pet is a happy pet.
                        Vet Visits: Schedule routine check-ups. Vaccinations, parasite control, and early detection of health issues are crucial.</p>

                      Socialization: Proper socialization during puppyhood or kittenhood reduces aggressive tendencies.</p>
